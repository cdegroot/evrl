EVRL used to stand for "East Veluwe Research Labs", when I lived in [that](http://maps.google.com/?ll=52.072332,6.04557&spn=0.148142,0.360489&t=h&z=12&vpsrc=6) nook of the world. Now, it's just a handy 4-letter site to take my musings and writings.

Small disclaimer: whatever is on this site, it will never reflect the official opinion of whoever is my employer when you read this or when I write this :)

Over time, I hope to add new articles, etcetera, to this site. Until then, I have a quick selection of older articles on my [personal site](http://www.cdegroot.com/articles/)

My name is Cees de Groot (pronounce it as "case"), and I live in rural Ontario, permanently working from home. I can recommend it.

At the moment, I'm a principal software engineer at PagerDuty, where I'm mostly responsible for the back-end systems.

See [my LinkedIn profile](http://nl.linkedin.com/in/cdegroot) for more work details.
