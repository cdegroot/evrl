The Raspberry Pi 3 is a wonderful little device. I have two, one to toy with and
one as a media box attached to the living room TV. Then my SO wanted to do AirPrint,
so I installed CUPS and Avahi and then discovered that there are no standard HBPL1
drivers, which my Dell C1660w needs.

After some digging, I found a [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~nicholson-mark/+archive/ubuntu/ppa)
that had patched [foo2zjs](http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/) drivers. I'm doing a lot of compiles
on my RPi3, so I was already setup to build the ARMv7 packages - here they are:

- [printer-driver-foo2zjs-common_20160407dfsg0-1_all.deb](/deb/printer-driver-foo2zjs-common_20160407dfsg0-1_all.deb)
- [printer-driver-foo2zjs-hbpl1_20160407dfsg0-1_armhf.deb](/deb/printer-driver-foo2zjs-hbpl1_20160407dfsg0-1_armhf.deb)
- [printer-driver-foo2zjs_20160407dfsg0-1_armhf.deb](/deb/printer-driver-foo2zjs_20160407dfsg0-1_armhf.deb)

Hope I can help someone else :-)
