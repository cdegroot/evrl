Following up on [my post on
"Design"](http://evrl.com/programming/2017/12/02/design.html), I'd like
to take a bit deeper dive on this whole "engineering" business, because
I think the topic is worth an article.

A couple of weeks ago I joked at a company event that our company employs
more people who played major league sports than actual engineers.  Still,
we have a whole department called "engineering", complete with a guy
who carries the burden of having to hand out business cards with "Sr VP,
Engineering". At the same time, I'm quite sure that calling yourself an
engineer without actually being a licensed engineer is not legal either
in California, where we are headquartered, or in Ontario, where we employ
a ton of people (at what we in Canada like to call "our other HQ" ;-)).

I get it why we want to have expensive sounding titles on our business
cards, and I can be frank: it sure looks posh, seeing "Principal Software
Engineer" below my name on a nicely designed business card. There is
also some history: there were times where people were convinced that
the way forward in our profession was to look at Engineering, and you
can make a case that we probably should; Engineering is a protected
discipline because it deals with stuff that is risky in the sense that
life and limb of the public is in danger if engineers get it wrong. With
"software eating the world", that is more and more the case for us, too.

But wishing it were true and it being true are two different
things. You can't start calling yourself a medical doctor just because
you think you should be one.

Also, putting labels on people influences how they behave, and I'm frankly
not sure that at least my nook of the world (Internet/SaaS style stuff)
is ready to adopt engineering behaviours or even should be ready to do
so. Still, we call you an "engineer" and then you start behaving like
one. To me, it seems that that's the cause for a lot of "overengineered"
software that I've seen around, especially in my work in North America
where abuse of this term seems to be most prevalent.

I've thought long about what our job entails, and as I don't just want
to rant let me share my thoughts on what we should call ourselves.

First, let's make the distinction between what my skills are and what
my employer wants me to do. It is subtle, but I think it is important.

My _craft_ is that I program computers, an area I've been honing my
skills in since '76 or so. Therefore I used to call myself a "computer
programmer" but since we've moved on to distributed systems, then cloud, and
now serverless the "computer" becomes a more and more nebulous concept;
the second-best term I can come up with is "software developer", and I
think that that's a nice label. It's a bit broader, but it is still a
pretty precise fit with what I can do and where my specialization lies.

My _job_ is, and has been in the previous couple of jobs, to work with
other people towards the goal of developing _product_. Not necessarily
_software_, because product is software and then some stuff. When I
joined an eBay subsidiary in 2007 I had to get used to the term, but I
think that the label "product developent" for the departments I've since
worked in is an excellent match.

So, I'm a software developer working in the product development department
of PagerDuty.

Why is this important? Apart from the fact that it avoids muddy legal
waters around the incorrect application of the term "engineer", it is
a much better description of what we do and what we're supposed to do.

We're not supposed to engineer marvellous structures, or even supersafe
software, or stable software, or whatnot. Quality in engineering is pretty
much an absolute (sorry, you need that much insulation on your 110VAC
cable, no way around it, laws of nature and such); quality in bringing
your startup to the next level in revenue might get sacrificed (hopefully
temporarily) in favour of quickly whipping out some functionality in
order to lure in that 5,000 seat deal.

We're also not supposed to sit in our cubicles 9x5 and just "program
computers". Our jobs have evolved beyond that - we expanded it upstream
towards design and architecture, and downstream towards deployment and
operations. We need to cooperate with other people, and therefore our
jobs have become much more social than in, say, the '90s.

We _are_ supposed to advance our company goals by developing its products,
though. That will often involve writing code, hopefully sometimes avoiding
that (by integrating existing open source or commercial solutions),
and most importantly by thinking along with people who are good at product
management to shape the roadmap; more often than not, the most effective
thing you can do in product development is not writing the best code,
but making sure that the plans from "product" and marketing are such
that they're simple to implement. Win upstream and writing the code
becomes an afterthought. Seeing ourselves as product developers with
software development skills broadens the horizon and liberates us
from being "just engineers". Words matter.
