It's been a while since I last learned a language I was going to use
full-time at work, and usually that means hard work to master the
thing; the drawback of being considered a senior is that people
expect you to be an expert at everything, so you need to work really
hard in order to not disappoint them ;-). Really studying a language (not
like [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://amzn.to/2MVN6zZ))
made me think about how we're learning in our profession versus
other areas of skill I happen to know a bit about, like performing
classical music.

My parents sent me to music school around the same time I started
elementary school, so reading sheet music and reading written words
are probably just as natural to me. After a few years of the basics,
I got sent to a piano teacher to learn a proper instrument (until then,
it was recorder which is a beautiful instrument but not in the hands of
a six year old). The next decade-and-a-bit, after some initial crises
over not wanting to learn playing the darn thing, I got to like it and
got proficient basically by working real hard. Later on, I repeated that
by getting training in trombone and (classical) singing; to my surprise,
it was way easier to learn trombone as a thirty-something year old than
learning piano as a six year old. I guess experience _does_ count.

Looking back, if I contrast learning a musical instrument with
learning a new language, especially in a work environment, there
are some differences that stand out.

Most importantly, when you are a performer, your study-to-performing
ratio is probably close to ten  hours of practice to each hour of
performance. If you are a computer programmer,
it is probably one to a hundred, if you're lucky. No wonder that
the guy sitting in front of the orchestra behind a concert grand
piano can do these awesome feats - he had oodles of time to prepare
for the event. I've never been much of an
athlete, but the same holds there: when I was training for the
university's varsity rowing team, half a year of exercise prepared
for a couple of months of racing (I wasn't selected, by the way, but
still got very fit :-)). We just get [Programming Ruby](https://amzn.to/2NAIlNt) dropped
on our desk and are expected to be coding important stuff a week later.

I think it'd be a bit rich to go to our respective employers and
ask them for 3 months of training time for every week of coding
on projects, or something similar, but it does show that "practice
makes perfect" holds true and you want to get as much of it as you
can.

Of course, I'm hardly the first one to make that observation. By
now, the practice of [code katas](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/) is
quite common, but every time I go through them, it felt like something
was lacking. Then I started working on a hobby project, [Uderzo](https://github.com/cdegroot/uderzo_poncho/),
which made things fall in place. Bear with me on a little detour
through music again.

When learning an instrument, there are three levels of practice which
I think are each important in their own right:

* _Scales_ allow you to warm up, in analog instruments like trombone
  tune your ear and muscles to hit the right tone, and basically help
  you in complicated pieces by help train muscle memory to commonly
  occurring sequences of notes.
* _Études_ are basically scales on steroids. They are musical pieces
  that purely exist to practice certain techniques on a larger scale
  than just scales. Chords, sequences, complicated musical transformations,
  most of the stuff you will encounter in a performance piece will be
  there. Some people are so gifted that their study pieces become
  performance pieces, Chopin probably being the best known example
  in the piano world.
* _Performance pieces_ are the big sonatas, concertos, and what not
  that makes an audience come and attend and maybe even pay. These are,
  in a way, the actual thing you want to do because that's what
  brings home the bacon.

I was a lazy student, so I focused as much as possible on the last and
as little as possible on the first two until I got older and got to
appreciate the value of practice. When I look at our craft, I see
a missing link: code katas, to me, are like scales - very low level
exercises that help you train muscle memory, learn the libraries of
your languages, and makes you think a bit about small-scale algorithms
now and then.

But that's hardly the most important part of programming. The trickiest
bit is to construct (design, architect, pick a word) whole applications,
not to write an implementation of Bloom filters. Where are our études?

I think that you need your own (open source) projects for that. Build a
whole system: it needs to have persistence, a user interface, business
logic and algorithms, and should be scratching your own itch so you
don't get bored and give up after two nights. Not just an algorithm
or library routine, but a whole system. Including the parts you don't
like. Designing systems in new languages is where the rubber meets the
road and I think that doing this a couple of times is mandatory practice
before you start to work on that nuclear power plant control system
your boss tasked you with. Implement a blogging system, a Pong clone,
some IoT device. Don't stop at katas, you'll be missing out on the stuff
that really matters in a programming language: how to fit all the bits
and pieces together into a coherent and maintainable whole, what the
right and the wrong libraries are, how to find and optimize the performance
bottlenecks, et cetera. That is the sort of practice that makes perfect.

Then, you can go to your boss and ask to be able to study for your
"concert piece" three times by doing the project twice, tossing it away,
and then going for the final performance. If only... I guess the
analogy has to break down somewhere ;-)
