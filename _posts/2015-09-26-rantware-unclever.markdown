New stuff: rantware. Sometimes, enough is enough, and you go off
on a rant. Lately, I had that a couple of times and in order to
channel the energy into something productive, I've invented "rantware".
Rants that result in code.

The first installment is called
[unclever](http://github.com/cdegroot/unclever). It's a rant against
bloated ORM (and similar libraries) that hide important details.
Instead, I've tried to create a minimal wrapper around the most-often
used JDBC functions.

Unclever is a work in progress, details in Github at the link above.
Feedback is very welcome, as pull requests or as constructive
comments in issues.
